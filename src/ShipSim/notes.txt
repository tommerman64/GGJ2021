needed systems:
A) ship movement and collision DONE
B) bullets and hit events - Colby
C) Pickup and drop off - Tom
D) Attachment and inventory DONE

ABC all need to share transform/bounding box info. So that will probably all be one shared cache that only is written to by movement system

Entity types:
player ship (all systems)
big ship (pickup and drop off)
loot box (ship movement, bullets and hit events)
pickup (ship movement, inventory)
